# Fraud Detection Machine Learning Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for fraud detection using a dataset of financial transactions. The project includes the following steps:

1. Creating a dataset and saving it as a CSV file
2. Preprocessing the data
3. Creating multiple visually appealing plots with seaborn
4. Fitting and evaluating a model of the fraud detection data

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need to install the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To run the project, you can use the provided Jupyter notebook `fraud_detection.ipynb`. The notebook includes all the necessary code to create the dataset, preprocess the data, create plots, fit and evaluate the model.

You can open the notebook in Jupyter by running the following command in your terminal:

```
jupyter notebook fraud_detection.ipynb
```
