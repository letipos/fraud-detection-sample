# Python Code Packages

## What are Python Code Packages?

Python Code Packages are a way to organize and distribute a Python codebase as a reusable library or application. By creating a distribution format for the code, other developers can easily install and use it. A package is created that contains a directory or archive with your project's code and all the dependencies it needs to run.

Packaging your Python project offers several benefits, including:

1. `Reusability`: By packaging your project, you make it easier for other developers to use and integrate your code into their own projects.
2. `Dependency management`: By including all your project's dependencies in the package, you can ensure that your code works correctly regardless of the dependencies the user has installed on their system.
3. `Versioning`: By specifying a version number for your package, you can ensure that users can easily track changes and update their code to the latest version.

## Setuptools and Python Packaging

Setuptools is a Python package that provides tools for building and distributing Python packages. It allows you to define package metadata, dependencies, and entry points in a simple and easy-to-use format.

To package your Python project using setuptools, you need to create a `setup.py` file in your project directory. This file defines the package information and dependencies, as well as any entry points or console scripts.

Once you have defined your `setup.py` file, you can use the `setuptools` command line tool to build and distribute your package. This tool creates a distribution package that contains your project's code and all its dependencies, and can be easily installed and used by other developers.

## Installing and Importing Packaged Files and Functions

Installation
To install a Python package that has been created using `setuptools`, you can use the pip package manager. First, navigate to the directory containing the package files and run the following command to build the distribution package:

```
python setup.py sdist
```

This will create a `.tar.gz` file in the dist directory, which can be installed using pip:

```
pip install <path-to-package-file>.tar.gz
```

After installing, you can import the functions and modules in the package using standard Python import statements.

Here's an example of importing a function named create_dataset from a package named `fraud_detection_project`:

```
from fraud_detection_project.ml_functions import create_dataset

data = create_dataset()
```

This will import the create_dataset function from the `ml_functions` module in the `fraud_detection_project` package, and assign the returned data to the data variable.
